What this mod changes

This version of the Master Sword is meant to be use without any fusion. I prefer to keep my Master Sword look throughout play. Damage is balanced for this idea. Light Dragon infused blade makes sense because *insert story spoilers here*.

Master Sword:
-Infinite Durability
-Guard Break Power increased from 40 to 72
-Impulse from 1500 to 3000 (Basically the weapon's OOMPH factor) Hits like a Two Hander now.
-Added Self Healing (Light Dragon Parts), Demolisher, and Tree Cutter. (Breaks rocks, cuts trees, chops boxes and barrels with ease.)
-Unlocked Sword Beam - No longer requires Max HP.
-Sword Beam Power increased from 10 to 45.
-Sword Beam width x10.
-Sword Beam Range increased from 20 to 240 (Looks like half that at best.)

Seven Different Versions, each having their own element.
Light - Self Healing effect on melee hits.
Fire - Fire Damage Attribute, no warming effect.
Ice - Ice Damage Attribute, no cooling effect. A favorite of mine.
Lightning - Lightning Damage Attribute
Wind - Wind Bursts with every attack.
Storm - Light, Fire, Ice, and Lightning combined. Game Randomly assigns elements. Try using Charge Attacks those do waves of different elements.
God - All of the above effects combined into one powerhouse. Honestly OP.

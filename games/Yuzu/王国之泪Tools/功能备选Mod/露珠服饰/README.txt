This mod is a collection of outfits for Riju:
Charged outfit: Based on the Charged set.
Trendy outfit: Based on the Cece Hat.
Stable Trotter outfit: Based on the outfits worn by NPCs at stables.
Vai outfit: Based on BotW's Gerudo set.
Purah outfit: Based on Purah's TotK outfit.
Island Getaway outfit: Based on the NPC Lurelin dress outfit.
Link outfit: Based on the Wild set.

The UI is also modified to reflect the outfit Riju is wearing.
If you get a black screen/crashes on load, make sure to delete the RSTB that doesnt match your version in System/Resource!

== Customization options
* Shock Damage comes installed by default (The file with shock damage is larger by default, making RSTB easier to work with). To remove it, copy Weapon_Sword_152_Main.pack.zs from the Remove folder to the mod's romfs/Pack (or delete the file from the mod). You can copy from the Add folder to add it back.

* There is a set of alternate portraits for the Purah outfit provided in Customization/Purah Outfit UI. If you would like to use them, copy all the contents of the CharaDirectory folder to the mod's romfs/UI/Tex/CharaDirectory.

== Known issues
* Stable Trotter / Link Outfit Riju still have heel sounds.
* Outfits with headwear aren't compatible with the Vah Naboris Helmet in the sense that the headwear won't be hidden properly.
* Island Getaway Riju has shading issues on the shirt.

This mod was primarily tested on Console with v1.1.2. There may be crashes or issues with other configurations.
You can find a YAML with RSTB values in the 'Merge Data' folder.
